              My programming journey began with a curiosity to understand how
              websites and apps work. I started by learning HTML and CSS to
              build simple static pages, and discovering JavaScript opened up a
              world of interactivity. That interest pushed me to explore React,
              Node.js, and MongoDBâ€”eventually becoming confident with the full
              MERN stack.

              I enjoy creating full-stack web applications that are fast,
              responsive, and user-friendly. Frontend development with React,
              Tailwind, and Framer Motion is my favorite part, but I also like
              solving backend challenges and building APIs. Turning designs into
              real, functional interfaces is especially rewarding for me.

              Beyond programming, I stay energized by playing football,
              listening to music, exploring design, and following tech trends.
              These hobbies help me relax, stay creative, and return to coding
              with fresh ideas and perspective.
